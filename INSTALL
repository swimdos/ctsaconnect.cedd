Step 1.  Get the Sources

This project builds as a third level of the VIVO Project. Other
third level projects that use VIVO include Cornell's DataStaR.
To build this project as a developer you will need the source 
code for VIVO and VITRO.  Download the sources into directories
of your choosing.  The default location in deploy.properties is
vivo-code and vitro-code on the same level as your downloaded
ctsaconnect.cedd.  The locations of VIVO and VITRO are

 * VIVO  --> svn.code.sf.net/p/vivo/code
 * VITRO --> svn.code.sf.net/p/vivo/vitro/code


Step 2. Setup VIVO

Follow the instructions for setting up VIVO.  You'll need

 * MySQL
 * Tomcat6 or Tomcat7
 * ANT
 * Java

Step 3. Build

You'll use ant all to build the project.  You'll want to 
build with sudo as the user for tomcat (Tomcat6-->tomcat6, 
Tomcat7-->tomcat7).

sudo -u tomcatuser ant all
