#clear old data
# For a fresh harvest, the removal of the previous information maintains data integrity.
#	If you are continuing a partial run or wish to use the old and already retrieved
#	data, you will want to comment out this line since it could prevent you from having
# 	the required harvest data.  
rm -rf data

# Import XML
# For now we are working directly with XML files instead of working with a data feed.  Eventually
# a process will replace the read in file from the XSLT translator with a downloaded file

# Execute Translate
# This is the part of the script where the input data is transformed into valid RDF
#   Translate will apply an xslt file to the fetched data which will result in the data 
#   becoming valid RDF in the VIVO ontology
harvester-xsltranslator -X icd9-xsltranslator.config.xml

# Execute Translate
# This is the part of the script where the input data is transformed into valid RDF
#   Translate will apply an xslt file to the fetched data which will result in the data 
#   becoming valid RDF in the VIVO ontology
harvester-xsltranslator -X cpt-xsltranslator.config.xml

# Execute Transfer to import from record handler into local temp model
# From this stage on the script places the data into a Jena model. A model is a
#	data storage structure similar to a database, but in RDF.
# The harvester tool Transfer is used to move/add/remove/dump data in models.
# For this call on the transfer tool:
# -s refers to the source translated records file, which was just produced by the translator step
# -o refers to the destination model for harvested data
# -d means that this call will also produce a text dump file in the specified location 
#harvester-transfer -s translated-records.config.xml -o harvested-data.model.xml -d data/harvested-data/imported-records.rdf.xml
